    <h2>What is an Interaction?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Uranium is a group of interactions that enhance the functionality of an HTML element - but what <i>is</i> an interaction, exactly? In Uranium, an interaction is a behavior that you're assigning to HTML elements on a page. Uranium defines a group of <i>attributes</i> you can give to your HTML elements, allowing your users to interact with them in a new way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've created pages to describe each interaction provided by Uranium. Each interaction page will give a brief description of the interaction, followed by the attributes necessary to add to your HTML (and where to put them), along with some recommended CSS. Finally there will be a demonstration of the interaction with its HTML to illustrate one possible way to take advantage of the interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've gone through these demonstrations, and you're ready to take the next step, you might want to check out the <a href="{{site.url}}tutorial.html">tutorial</a> page, which takes you step-by-step through some examples of implementing interaction.
